# The Best Study Guide Ever

## Description

The motivation and purpose of building this website was to create a central hub for all of my notes that I will create and store throughout the process of the bootcamp experience. While making this very simple, yet dynamic, website I was able to learn brief introductions into coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I then applied that new knowledge and this is what I was able to create in just a little under 2 weeks of coding.  

## Installation

The following steps where instructed to me via Bootcamp Moduels.
First I was taught how to undertsand the computer using the GitBash terminal which I installed and got used to. Next, I was promted to download Visual Studio Code, and application I am learning to love already. Upon downloading and installing VS Code, I was also instructed to download an extentsion so I could see real time updates in my browser. After that, some files where downloaded to create the base platforming for my webpage which I then moved to the proper files and directories.  

## Usage

The purpose and usefulness of this webpage is to act as a virtual notebook for my pre work and possibly the rest of my time in this class.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

## Tests

Many many tests went into the project. The reason I tested it so much was not to see if different features were working but to practice my own skills that I had just recently learned. Hence why I have so many commits on my GitHub profile already was because I practiced my Git FLow for almost every single small change I made while developing this project.
